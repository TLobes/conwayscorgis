## Conwayâ€™s Game of Corgis

Started at [FullStack Pair Programming @ Opodz](http://www.meetup.com/fullstackla/)

*Goal:* Build a visual representation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) with JavaScript

*Rules:*  
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
